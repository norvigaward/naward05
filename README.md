Song mentioning detection on the Common Crawl dataset
============

#### Abstract

We investigated the possibility of automatically developing lists of popular songs for different countries by detecting song mentionings in the Common Crawl dataset.
We found that that it is possible to efficiently determine the country of a web page and that is is possible to efficiently find mentionings of a large number of songs
titles (5.7 million) within these web pages. We find however that our current implementation is not sufficient as the amount of false positive song mention detections is too high,
but show that on a smaller set of songs, particular the Dutch top2000, the approach produces interesting reshuffeling of this list for different countries.
